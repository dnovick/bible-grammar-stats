# Notebooks Index

These notebooks demonstrate the full `bible_grammar` analysis toolkit across
the Hebrew Old Testament, Greek New Testament, and Septuagint (LXX). They cover
verb morphology, syntactic role search, speaker attribution, poetry analysis,
lexicon lookups, intertextuality, cross-testament trajectories, and more —
all backed by the MACULA Hebrew WLC and MACULA Greek Nestle1904 syntax trees.
