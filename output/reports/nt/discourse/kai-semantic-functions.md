## Overview

καί (G2532) is the single most frequent word in the GNT with **8,978 tokens**. Although its default translation is "and" (additive coordination), it serves a range of semantic functions that carry significant exegetical weight — particularly the **ascensive** ("even") and **adjunctive** ("also") uses, which are often obscured by flat translation.

Classification uses the per-token translator gloss from the MACULA Greek syntax layer (Nestle 1904), which captures contextual usage at the word level.

## GNT-Wide Function Profile

![καί function distribution](../../../charts/nt/discourse/nt_kai_functions.png)

| Function | Count | % | Description |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **additive** | 8,060 | 89.8% | additive — coordinates clauses, phrases, or words (most common) |
| **adjunctive** | 684 | 7.6% | adjunctive — "also"; adds a parallel or supplementary element |
| **ascensive** | 118 | 1.3% | ascensive — "even / indeed"; intensifies or raises the rhetorical register |
| **correlative** | 41 | 0.5% | correlative — "both … and"; pairs two elements symmetrically |
| **adversative** | 41 | 0.5% | adversative — "but / yet / although"; marks contrast or concession |
| **temporal** | 16 | 0.2% | temporal — "then"; indicates sequence in narrative |
| **explicative** | 13 | 0.1% | explicative — "that"; introduces a content clause |
| **other** | 5 | 0.1% | other — miscellaneous / context-dependent uses |

## Key Observations

- **Additive dominates** (89.8% of all καί tokens) — plain coordination is the overwhelmingly default use.

- **Adjunctive καί** ("also") is the second-most-common function at 7.6%. It is a hallmark of Pauline argumentation: Rom (23.8%), Gal (18.1%), Eph (15.3%).

- **Ascensive καί** ("even / indeed") appears 118 times GNT-wide. It is rare but exegetically significant — missing it in translation flattens the rhetorical force of the clause.

- Books with the **highest adjunctive %**: 2Co (24.4%), Rom (23.8%), Col (20.8%), Php (20.6%), 1Pe (19.7%).

- Books with the **highest ascensive %**: Phm (11.1%), Gal (6.9%), Php (6.5%), 2Co (6.1%), Jud (4.8%).
