# Greek NT Case Distribution by Book

Case distribution for declined words (Nouns, Articles, Adjectives) in each NT book,
shown as a percentage of all declined words in that book.

**Cases included:** Nominative, Genitive, Accusative, Dative, Vocative.  
**Words counted:** Nouns, Articles, and Adjectives only — the three POS with fully
declined forms in TAGNT. Pronouns are excluded as their case coding uses a different
scheme in the source data.

## Observations

- **John and 1 John have the highest nominative rates** (41.6% and 38.3%) — consistent with their direct declarative style. Subject-predicate constructions ("I am the light," "God is love") favor the nominative.
- **Acts has the lowest nominative rate (23.8%) and highest accusative rate (34.4%)** — Acts is the most action-packed NT book, with verbs taking direct objects (accusative) driving the narrative.
- **The Pauline epistles shift heavily toward genitive**, especially 2 Thessalonians (38.1%), Ephesians (32.0%), Colossians (30.1%), and Hebrews (32.4%). Paul's theological argumentation frequently uses genitive chains ("the righteousness of God," "the body of Christ," "the spirit of wisdom").
- **The dative is highest in the Prison Epistles**: Ephesians (22.4%), Colossians (24.8%), Philemon (22.9%). This reflects dative of reference/advantage constructions common in ethical/community instruction.
- **Romans has a uniquely even distribution** (26.8% / 26.8% / 26.8% across Nom/Gen/Acc) — a signature of its carefully balanced dialectical argument.
- **2 Thessalonians has the highest genitive rate** (38.1%) for its length — a small letter with a dense concentration of genitive phrases in its eschatological discourse.
- **James has the highest vocative rate** (3.6%), reflecting its sermon-like address to "brothers" (ἀδελφοί, vocative) throughout.
