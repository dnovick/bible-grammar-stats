# Intertextuality Network

Given any OT verse, chapter, or book, find all NT verses that quote or allude
to it — scored by community vote confidence (scrollmapper / OpenBible.info).

**Usage:** `/intertextuality <OT-ref> [min_votes]`

OT reference formats:
  - `Isa 53`      — chapter scope (all verses in Isaiah 53)
  - `Isa 53:5`    — single verse
  - `Isa`         — full book (summarised at NT-book level)
  - `Psa 22`      — Psalm 22 chapter

Default min_votes: 20 (lower = more results, less certain; higher = fewer, very confident)

**Output includes:**
- NT book coverage summary (how many citations per book)
- Per-OT-verse breakdown with KJV text for both OT and NT sides
- Network graph PNG (OT verses → NT verses/books)
- Markdown report + CSV saved to `output/reports/`

**Examples:**
- `/intertextuality Isa 53`       — Isaiah 53 (the Servant Song)
- `/intertextuality Psa 22`       — Psalm 22 (My God My God)
- `/intertextuality Isa 53:5`     — single verse
- `/intertextuality Deu 6:4`      — the Shema
- `/intertextuality Isa 40`       — Voice in the wilderness
- `/intertextuality Gen 22 15`    — Binding of Isaac (lower threshold)
