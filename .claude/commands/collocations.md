# Collocation Statistics

Find words that significantly co-occur with a target Hebrew or Greek root —
words appearing nearby more often than chance predicts.

**Usage:** `/collocations <strongs> [window=5] [corpus=OT|NT]`

**Output includes:**
- Observed co-occurrence count vs expected (under independence)
- PMI (Pointwise Mutual Information) — how surprising the pairing is
- G² log-likelihood — statistical confidence (more reliable for rare words)
- Sorted by G² descending

**Examples:**
- `/collocations H7307` — רוּחַ (spirit) in OT — finds east-wind, breath, tempest, prophesy
- `/collocations G3056` — λόγος (word) in NT — finds hear, sow, God, speak
- `/collocations H1697` — דָּבָר (word) in OT
- `/collocations H2617` — חֶסֶד (lovingkindness) in OT
