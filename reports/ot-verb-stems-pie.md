distant second.

| Pual | 494 | 0.8% | Intensive passive (passive of Piel) |
| Hophal | 418 | 0.6% | Causative passive (passive of Hiphil) |

| **Total** | **65,562** | **100%** | |

## Key Observations

### Qal dominance (70.7%)
The Qal is the default stem — simple, active, unmarked. It is used for nearly
every common verb in its ordinary sense: to go, to come, to see, to hear, to
speak (Qal), to eat, to die. Its overwhelming frequency reflects that most
verbal action in the OT is narrated straightforwardly.

### The Hiphil (11.5%) — called out
The Hiphil is the **causative active** stem: it takes a simple action and
makes someone *cause* it to happen. Examples:

- יָצָא (Qal) "to go out" → יוֹצִיא (Hiphil) "to bring out, cause to go out"
- מוּת (Qal) "to die" → הֵמִית (Hiphil) "to kill, cause to die"
- יָדַע (Qal) "to know" → הוֹדִיעַ (Hiphil) "to make known, declare"

At 11.5%, the Hiphil's prevalence reflects the OT's strong emphasis on divine
and human agency — God bringing out, making known, causing rain to fall,
giving victory, etc.

### Piel (8.4%)
The Piel carries intensive or factitive nuance: it either intensifies the
simple action (שָׁבַר Qal "to break" → שִׁבֵּר Piel "to smash/shatter") or
declares someone to be what the Qal describes (קָדַשׁ Qal "to be holy" →
קִדֵּשׁ Piel "to sanctify, treat as holy"). The Piel is particularly common
in cultic and legal texts.

### Niphal (6.1%)
The Niphal functions as the simple passive or reflexive: "to be seen," "to be
called," "to be saved." Its relatively modest frequency compared to the Hiphil
and Piel reflects that Hebrew prefers active constructions.

### Passive stems (Pual, Hophal — combined 1.4%)
The Pual (passive of Piel) and Hophal (passive of Hiphil) are rare. Hebrew
generally avoids double-marking passives; the Niphal handles most passive
needs.

## Data Notes

- Total reflects tagged verb tokens only; untagged prefix tokens (~4,287 rows
  with blank stem) are excluded.
- Aramaic verbs (Daniel, Ezra) use the Haphel/Pael/Shaphel stems, which appear
  in the "Other" category.
