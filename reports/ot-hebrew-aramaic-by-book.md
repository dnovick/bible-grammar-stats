# Hebrew vs. Aramaic Word Distribution in the OT

The Hebrew Bible contains two languages: **Biblical Hebrew** (the vast majority) and
**Biblical Aramaic** (concentrated in Daniel and Ezra, with scattered loanwords elsewhere).
The TAHOT morphology data tags each word with its language, enabling precise separation.

## The Aramaic Sections

### Daniel (32.6% Aramaic — 1,928 words)

Daniel is the most bilingual OT book. The Aramaic section spans **Dan 2:4b–7:28**,
covering the court narratives and apocalyptic visions addressed to the nations, while
the Hebrew sections (chapters 1, 8–12) frame the book's introduction and Daniel's
personal visions addressed to Israel.

### Ezra (20.9% Aramaic — 786 words)

Ezra's Aramaic sections contain official Persian imperial correspondence:
- **Ezra 4:8–6:18** — letters between Persian officials and kings Artaxerxes and Darius
- **Ezra 7:12–26** — Artaxerxes' decree authorizing Ezra's mission

The use of Aramaic here is historically appropriate — Aramaic was the administrative
language (*lingua franca*) of the Persian Empire.

### Scattered Aramaic (1–4%)

Books like Haggai (3.8%), Ecclesiastes (3.0%), Nehemiah (2.7%), and most others show
low Aramaic percentages reflecting **Aramaisms** — individual words borrowed from
Aramaic into late Biblical Hebrew — not contiguous Aramaic prose sections. This is
expected: Hebrew and Aramaic were closely related Semitic languages in ongoing contact,
and late Biblical Hebrew (post-exilic books) absorbed more Aramaic loanwords.

## Querying by Language

The `language` field is available in `query()` and `concordance()`:

```python
from bible_grammar import query

# Only Hebrew words in Daniel
query(book='Dan', language='Hebrew')

# Only Aramaic words in Daniel
query(book='Dan', language='Aramaic')

# Aramaic verbs in Ezra
query(book='Ezr', language='Aramaic', part_of_speech='Verb')

# All Aramaic in the OT
query(testament='OT', language='Aramaic')
```

## Notes on the Data

- Language tagging comes from STEPBible's TAHOT morphology, which tags each word token
  individually as `Hebrew` or `Aramaic`.
- The Aramaic morphology codes (Haphel, Pael, Shaphel, etc.) correspond to Aramaic
  verbal stems and appear in the `stem` column for Aramaic words.
- Books with < 1% Aramaic contain only isolated loanwords, not Aramaic sections.
