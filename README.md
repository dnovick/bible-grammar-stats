# Bible Grammar Stats

A Python project for generating statistics, charts, and reports on the grammatical
constructs of the biblical text — Hebrew and Aramaic Old Testament, Greek New Testament,
Greek Septuagint (LXX), and English/Latin translations.

The LXX (Septuagint) is the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures, and plays
a central role in this project: it bridges the Hebrew OT and Greek NT vocabulary, and is
the primary text NT authors quote when citing the Old Testament. This project supports
word-level alignment between the Hebrew OT and the LXX, per-book translation consistency
analysis, and NT quotation alignment that determines whether a NT author follows the LXX
wording or the Hebrew MT.

Built to answer questions like:
- *How many Niphal perfect verbs are in each book of the OT?*
- *What is the verb stem distribution across the Torah?*
- *How does Paul use the aorist passive compared to the rest of the NT?*
- *Where does the word "grace" appear in Paul's letters (KJV)?*
- *How consistently does the LXX render רוּחַ (spirit/wind) across books?*
- *Does Hebrews quote the OT following the LXX or the Hebrew MT?*
- *What Greek word does the LXX use to translate חֶסֶד (lovingkindness), and how does that word travel into the NT?*
- *Which words cluster significantly near שָׁלוֹם (peace) in the OT?*
- *How does Paul's use of Χριστός (Christ) compare to the Gospels? Where does the title concentrate?*
- *What OT passages does Isaiah 53 echo in the NT — and through which books?*
- *How do verb conjugation patterns differ between narrative prose and wisdom poetry?*

## Features

### Query API

The `query()` function is the core access point for morphological data.

```python
from bible_grammar import query

# Niphal perfect verbs in Genesis
query(book='Gen', stem='Niphal', conjugation='Perfect')

# All verbs in the Torah
query(book_group='torah', part_of_speech='Verb')

# Greek aorist passive indicatives in Paul's letters
query(book_group='pauline', tense='Aorist', voice='Passive', mood='Indicative')
```

**Available filters:** `source`, `book`, `testament`, `book_group` (torah/prophets/writings/
gospels/pauline/general), `chapter`, `verse`, `part_of_speech`, `stem`, `conjugation`,
`tense`, `voice`, `mood`, `person`, `number`, `gender`, `case_`, `state`

```python
from bible_grammar import translation_query

# KJV verses containing "grace" in Paul's letters
translation_query(translation='KJV', book_group='pauline', search='grace')

# Latin Vulgate — first chapter of Romans
translation_query(translation='VulgClementine', book='Rom', chapter=1)
```

---

### Word Study

Complete lexical and statistical profile for any Hebrew or Greek word.

```python
from bible_grammar import word_study, print_word_study

# Full word study dict
ws = word_study('H7307')   # רוּחַ spirit/wind
ws = word_study('G3056')   # λόγος word

# Formatted report to stdout
print_word_study('H1254')  # בָּרָא to create
print_word_study('G4160')  # ποιέω to do/make
```

Each study includes: lemma, transliteration, gloss, definition, total occurrences,
distribution by book, morphological forms breakdown, LXX translation equivalents
(Hebrew only, word-level IBM Model 1 alignment), and the OT→LXX→NT trajectory.

Lemmas can be resolved to Strong's numbers by name:

```python
from bible_grammar import resolve_strongs

resolve_strongs('שָׁלוֹם')   # → 'H7965'
resolve_strongs('λόγος')    # → 'G3056'
```

---

### Semantic Profile

A unified full-profile report combining lexicon entry, frequency, morphology, LXX equivalents,
collocations, and example verses into a single analysis.

```python
from bible_grammar import semantic_profile, print_semantic_profile, save_semantic_profile

# Terminal report
print_semantic_profile('H7965')   # שָׁלוֹם peace
print_semantic_profile('G3056')   # λόγος word

# Save as Markdown + PNG chart (OT → output/reports/ot/lexicon/, NT → output/reports/nt/lexicon/)
save_semantic_profile('H1285')    # בְּרִית covenant
save_semantic_profile('H7307')    # רוּחַ spirit/wind
```

Pre-generated profiles: בְּרִית, רוּחַ, שָׁלוֹם in `output/reports/ot/lexicon/`; λόγος in `output/reports/nt/lexicon/`.

---

### Concordance

```python
from bible_grammar import concordance, lemma_frequency, top_lemmas

# All occurrences of H7307 with KJV context
concordance(strongs='H7307', context='KJV')

# Frequency table for all lemmas in Psalms
lemma_frequency(book='Psa', corpus='OT')

# Top 20 lemmas in Romans
top_lemmas(book='Rom', n=20)
```

---

### Frequency Statistics

```python
from bible_grammar import freq_table
from bible_grammar import query

df = query(book_group='torah', part_of_speech='Verb')
freq_table(df, 'stem')           # Count by binyan (Qal, Piel, Niphal…)
freq_table(df, ['stem', 'book_id'])  # Cross-tab
```

---

### Book Profiles

Morphological fingerprint for any OT or NT book.

```python
from bible_grammar import book_profile, print_profile, batch_profiles

print_profile('Gen')   # Genesis: verb stems, top lemmas, morph breakdown
print_profile('Rom')   # Romans: tense/voice/mood distribution

# Compare multiple books
batch_profiles(['Gen', 'Exo', 'Lev', 'Num', 'Deu'])
```

---

### Translation Equivalents (IBM Model 1)

Statistical word-level alignment between the Hebrew OT and the LXX, trained using
IBM Model 1. Answers: *which Greek word does the LXX use to translate this Hebrew root?*

```python
from bible_grammar import translation_equivalents_w, hebrew_sources_w

# Top Greek renderings for H1285 (בְּרִית covenant)
translation_equivalents_w(heb_strongs='H1285')

# Top Hebrew sources for G1242 (διαθήκη covenant)
hebrew_sources_w(lxx_strongs='G1242')
```

---

### Collocation Statistics

Identifies words that co-occur with a target root significantly more than chance, scored
by Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and log-likelihood ratio (G²).

```python
from bible_grammar import collocations, print_collocations, collocation_network

# Top collocates of שָׁלוֹם (peace) in the OT
print_collocations('H7965', corpus='OT', window=5)

# Top collocates of εἰρήνη (peace) in the NT
print_collocations('G1515', corpus='NT', window=5)

# Heatmap comparing collocate overlap for multiple roots
collocation_network(['H7965', 'H2617', 'H6666'], output_path='output/charts/ot/lexicon/peace-network.png')
```

---

### Morphological Distribution

Per-book distribution of morphological forms for any root — Hebrew stem × conjugation,
Greek tense × voice, or Greek case.

```python
from bible_grammar import morph_distribution, print_morph_distribution, morph_chart

# OT verb — stem breakdown across books
print_morph_distribution('H1696')    # דָּבַר to speak
morph_chart('H1696', chart_type='stacked_bar',
            output_path='output/charts/ot/lexicon/dabar-stems.png')

# NT verb — tense × voice per book
morph_chart('G3004', chart_type='heatmap',
            output_path='output/charts/nt/lexicon/lego-tense.png')
```

---

### LXX Translation Consistency

Measures how uniformly each LXX book/translator renders a given Hebrew root.
High consistency (>90%) means one dominant Greek equivalent; low consistency or
divergent books may indicate semantic range, translation philosophy differences,
or recensional variation.

```python
from bible_grammar import lxx_consistency, print_lxx_consistency
from bible_grammar import consistency_heatmap, batch_consistency

# Per-book rendering profile for רוּחַ (spirit/wind)
print_lxx_consistency('H7307')

# Heatmap: rows=LXX lemmas, cols=OT books, cells=% usage
consistency_heatmap('H7307', output_path='output/charts/ot/lexicon/ruach-consistency.png')

# Batch summary across multiple roots
batch_consistency(['H7307', 'H1697', 'H2617', 'H6944'])
```

The `batch_consistency()` result across the full theological terms list shows:
- **100% consistent:** בְּרִית (covenant), שָׁלוֹם (peace), קֹדֶשׁ (holiness), חֶסֶד (lovingkindness)
- **Most divergent:** דָּבָר (word, 9 divergent books), מִשְׁפָּט (justice, 8 books), שׁוּב (return, 6 books)

---

### NT Quotations

Cross-reference database linking NT verses to their OT sources (scrollmapper,
vote-weighted confidence scores).

```python
from bible_grammar import nt_quotations, verse_comparison, quotation_table

# All NT quotations of Isaiah
nt_quotations(ot_book='Isa', min_votes=50)

# All OT quotations in Hebrews
nt_quotations(nt_book='Heb', min_votes=30)

# Side-by-side verse text comparison
verse_comparison(nt_book='Mat', nt_chapter=4, nt_verse=4)
```

---

### NT Quotation Word Alignment

For each NT→OT quotation, analyses whether the NT author's Greek vocabulary follows
the LXX wording or diverges toward the Hebrew MT. Per-word verdicts:

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `LXX` | NT word's Strong's number appears in the LXX rendering of the OT verse |
| `LXX+MT` | Matches LXX and the Hebrew root is also present in the OT verse |
| `MT-diverge` | NT word's Hebrew root is in the OT verse but the LXX used a different Greek word |
| `neutral` | Function word or no alignment data |

```python
from bible_grammar import quotation_align, print_quotation_align, batch_align

# Word-level analysis for a single NT verse
print_quotation_align('Mat', 4, 4)   # Deut 8:3 — "man shall not live by bread alone"

# Batch summary across all high-confidence quotations in Hebrews
df = batch_align(nt_book='Heb', min_votes=50)
```

---

### Intertextuality Network

Given any OT verse, chapter, or book, finds all NT verses that quote or allude to it,
scored by community vote confidence (scrollmapper / OpenBible.info). Produces a bipartite
network graph (OT verses on the left, NT books/verses on the right) and a full report.

```python
from bible_grammar import intertextuality, print_intertextuality
from bible_grammar import intertextuality_graph, intertextuality_report

# Chapter scope — Isaiah 53 → all NT citations
print_intertextuality('Isa', chapter=53, min_votes=20)

# Single verse — Psalm 22:1 ("My God, my God…")
print_intertextuality('Psa', chapter=22, verse=1, min_votes=15)

# Full book — all Isaiah links at high confidence
print_intertextuality('Isa', min_votes=50)

# Network graph PNG
intertextuality_graph('Isa', chapter=53, min_votes=20,
                      output_path='output/charts/both/intertextuality/isa53-network.png')

# Markdown report + CSV
intertextuality_report('Psa', chapter=22)
```

Vote scores reflect how many independent scholars have identified the connection;
scores ≥50 are strong explicit quotations, 20–49 are probable allusions, 10–19 are
possible echoes. Pre-generated reports for Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, and full Isaiah
are in `output/reports/both/intertextuality/`.

---

### NT Greek Syntax (MACULA)

`syntax.py` wraps the MACULA Greek Nestle1904 data (137,779 word tokens) with a
query API that exposes syntactic roles, participant referents, English glosses,
and Louw-Nida semantic domains. Each word token carries a `subjref` attribute
pointing to the xml_id of its grammatical subject.

```python
from bible_grammar import load_syntax, query_syntax, speech_verbs

df = load_syntax()    # 137,779 rows; cached as Parquet after first load

# John 1:1 with roles and glosses
query_syntax(book='Jhn', chapter=1, verse=1)[
    ['text', 'lemma', 'role', 'gloss', 'case_', 'tense']
]

# All aorist passive verbs in Romans
query_syntax(book='Rom', tense='aorist', voice='passive')

# Speech verbs (λέγω, φημί, λαλέω…) where Jesus is the grammatical subject
speech_verbs('Mat', subject_strong='2424')

# All Gospel verses where Jesus is the speaking subject
from bible_grammar import jesus_speaking_verses
gospel_books = ['Mat', 'Mrk', 'Luk', 'Jhn']
speaking = jesus_speaking_verses(gospel_books)   # set of (book, ch, vs) tuples
```

Available filters: `book`, `chapter`, `verse`, `strong`, `lemma`, `role`,
`class_`, `tense`, `voice`, `mood`, `case_`, `person`, `number`, `gender`,
`has_subjref`, `has_referent`.

---

### OT Hebrew Syntax (MACULA)

`syntax_ot.py` wraps the MACULA Hebrew WLC data (475k word tokens, 930
per-chapter lowfat XML files) with the same query API as `syntax.py` for
the NT.  Each word carries syntactic role, stem, clause type, and an inline
LXX alignment — the Greek word and Strong's number that translates this
specific token in the Septuagint.

```python
from bible_grammar import load_syntax_ot, query_syntax_ot, lxx_alignment

df = load_syntax_ot()     # 475,911 rows; cached as Parquet after first load

# Gen 1:1 with syntactic roles and LXX words
query_syntax_ot(book='Gen', chapter=1, verse=1)[
    ['text','lemma','strong_h','role','gloss','greek','greek_g','stem','type_']
]

# All wayyiqtol (narrative past) verbs in Genesis
query_syntax_ot(book='Gen', tense='wayyiqtol')     # 2,105 tokens

# Niphal perfects in Isaiah
query_syntax_ot(book='Isa', stem='niphal', tense='qatal')   # 97 tokens

# Aramaic sections (Daniel, Ezra, 2 words in Gen/Jer)
query_syntax_ot(lang='A')                          # 7,549 Aramaic tokens

# How does the LXX translate שָׁלוֹם?
lxx_alignment('H7965')
# → εἰρήνη 98%, σωτηρίας 2%

# How does the LXX translate רוּחַ?
lxx_alignment('H7307')
# → πνεῦμα 94%, ἄνεμος 5%
```

The inline LXX alignment in MACULA Hebrew is word-level, derived from the
actual syntax tree — a higher-precision source than the IBM Model 1 alignment
in `ibm_align.py`, complementing it for detailed OT↔LXX studies.

Available filters: `book`, `chapter`, `verse`, `strong_h`, `lemma`, `role`,
`stem`, `pos`, `lang`, `tense` (wayyiqtol/qatal/yiqtol/…), `person`, `gender`,
`number`, `state`, `greekstrong`, `has_subjref`, `has_participantref`.

---

### Speaker Attribution

`speaker.py` identifies which NT verses contain Jesus speaking, using two
complementary strategies that combine into a single `is_jesus_speaking()` predicate:

1. **Curated allowlists** — hand-curated frozensets of (book, chapter, verse) triples
   for Son of Man sayings (74 Gospel verses), all seven Johannine I AM declarations,
   and Bridegroom parables. Confidence is 100%.
2. **MACULA subjref detection** — speech verbs (λέγω, φημί, λαλέω, ἀποκρίνομαι,
   εἶπεν, ὁμολογέω, κράζω) whose `subjref` resolves to Iesous (G2424) in the
   MACULA Greek syntax tree.

```python
from bible_grammar import is_jesus_speaking, jesus_speaking_verse_set, ALLOWLIST_VERSES

# Is Jesus the speaking subject in this verse?
is_jesus_speaking('Mat', 16, 13)   # True  — "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
is_jesus_speaking('Jhn', 8, 58)    # True  — "Before Abraham was born, I AM"
is_jesus_speaking('Mat', 3, 17)    # False — God speaks, not Jesus

# Full set of Gospel verses where Jesus speaks
speaking_set = jesus_speaking_verse_set(['Mat', 'Mrk', 'Luk', 'Jhn'])

# View curated allowlists
print(list(ALLOWLIST_VERSES.keys()))
# ['Son of Man', 'I AM', 'Bridegroom']
```

---

### Lexicon API

`lexicon.py` provides a clean public API for the TBESH (Hebrew) and TBESG (Greek)
Translators Brief lexicons from STEPBible, centralizing parsing that was previously
duplicated. Each entry includes Strong's number, lemma, transliteration, POS code,
gloss, and full definition.

```python
from bible_grammar import lookup, search_gloss, lex_entry, lemma_index

# Dict lookup by Strong's number
lookup('H7965')    # {'strongs': 'H7965', 'lemma': 'שָׁלוֹם', 'gloss': 'peace', ...}
lookup('G3056')    # {'strongs': 'G3056', 'lemma': 'λόγος', 'gloss': 'word', ...}

# Pretty-print a full lexicon article
lex_entry('H2617')    # חֶסֶד — lovingkindness / steadfast love

### Christological Titles

`christological_titles.py` counts how frequently Jesus used various titles to
refer to Himself across the four Gospels. An optional **speaker filter** restricts
counts to verses where Jesus is the grammatical speaking subject, removing narrator
references and other characters' uses of the titles.

```python
from bible_grammar import title_counts, print_title_counts, title_chart, title_verses

# All Gospel occurrences (unfiltered)
print_title_counts(scope='gospels', speaker_filter=False)

# Only where Jesus is the speaking subject (more precise)
print_title_counts(scope='gospels', speaker_filter=True)

# Bar chart
title_chart(scope='gospels', speaker_filter=True,
            output_path='output/charts/nt/names/christological-titles.png')

# All (book, ch, vs) tuples for a specific title
title_verses('I AM')          # 7 Johannine I AM sayings
title_verses('Son of Man')    # 76 filtered occurrences across the Gospels
```

**Effect of speaker filter:** Son of Man 88→76, Son of God 42→7, Kyrios 244→16.
The filter removes instances where the narrator, disciples, or opponents use the
title — leaving only Jesus' direct self-references.

### Syntactic Role Search

`role_search.py` answers "who does what to whom" by following MACULA `subjref`
links. Given one or more Strong's numbers, it finds all verb tokens whose
grammatical subject resolves to those entities — for both OT Hebrew and NT Greek.

```python
from bible_grammar import subject_verbs, verb_subjects, print_role_summary
from bible_grammar import role_chart, divine_action_comparison, role_report
from bible_grammar import GOD_OT, GOD_NT, JESUS_NT

# What does God (YHWH + Elohim) do in the OT?
print_role_summary(['H3068', 'H0430'], corpus='OT', top_n=20, label='YHWH+Elohim')

# What does God do in the NT?
print_role_summary(['G2316'], corpus='NT', top_n=20, label='Theos')

# What does Jesus do in the Gospels?
print_role_summary(['G2424'], corpus='NT', books=['Mat', 'Mrk', 'Luk', 'Jhn'],
                   label='Iesous')

# YHWH's verbs in Isaiah only
print_role_summary(['H3068'], corpus='OT', books=['Isa'])

# Who takes בָּרָא (bara, create) as their grammatical subject?
# Result: exclusively divine entities (plus 2 edge cases)
verb_subjects('H1254', corpus='OT')

# Side-by-side OT/NT chart: God's top verbs in each corpus
ot_df, nt_df, chart_path = divine_action_comparison()

# Full Markdown report with book distribution and cross-testament comparison
role_report(['H3068', 'H0430'], corpus='OT', label='YHWH+Elohim',
            include_cross_testament=True)
```

Pre-generated report: `output/reports/ot/names/role-yhwh-elohim-ot.md`.

**Slash command:** `/role-search H3068,H0430` or `/role-search G2424 NT Mat Mrk Luk Jhn`

---

### Object / Argument Search

`role_search.py` also provides the *symmetric* direction: given an entity's Strong's
number(s), find what verbs are performed *on* that entity, and what objects verbs
with that subject act upon — the patient/object slots of the predicate.

**OT method:** parses the MACULA Hebrew verb `frame` column (`A0`=agent, `A1`=patient)
to find verb→object triples where `A0` resolves to the target entity.

**NT method:** finds verbs with the target as `subjref` subject, then collects
co-verse tokens tagged `role='o'` or `role='o2'`.

```python
from bible_grammar import subject_objects, object_verbs, print_object_summary

# What does YHWH+Elohim act upon in the OT?
print_object_summary(['H3068', 'H0430'], corpus='OT', top_n=20)

# What does Jesus act upon in the Gospels?
print_object_summary(['G2424'], corpus='NT', books=['Mat', 'Mrk', 'Luk', 'Jhn'])

# What verbs are performed ON Israel?
object_verbs('H3478', corpus='OT')

# What is done TO the disciples (G3101) in the NT?
object_verbs('G3101', corpus='NT')

# Get raw verb+object pairs as a DataFrame
df = subject_objects(['H3068'], corpus='OT', books=['Isa'])
```

**Slash command:** `/object-search H3068,H0430` or `/object-search G2424 NT Mat Mrk Luk Jhn`

### LXX as a Queryable Corpus

`lxx_query.py` exposes the full Septuagint (Rahlfs 1935, CenterBLC edition,
623,693 tokens) as a first-class queryable corpus with the same filter API
as `query.py` and `syntax.py`. Covers all 39 canonical OT books plus
deuterocanonical books; filters for canonical-only are on by default.

Each token carries: word form, lemma, transliteration, gloss, Strong's number,
part of speech, tense, voice, mood, case, number, gender, person.

```python
from bible_grammar import (query_lxx, lxx_by_book, lxx_freq_table,
                            lxx_concordance, lxx_verb_stats, print_lxx_query)

# Word query — all occurrences of διαθήκη (covenant) in the LXX
query_lxx(strongs='G1242')

# Restrict to a book or group
query_lxx(strongs='G2316', book='Isa')          # θεός in Isaiah
query_lxx(strongs='G4151', book_group='prophets')  # πνεῦμα in Prophets
query_lxx(lemma='εἰρήνη')                       # all peace occurrences

# Per-book counts
lxx_by_book(strongs='G1242')     # διαθήκη in canonical order

# Verb morphology breakdown
lxx_verb_stats(strongs='G4160')  # ποιέω tense/voice/mood

# Frequency table of any column
lxx_freq_table('tense', part_of_speech='Verb', book_group='prophets')
lxx_freq_table(['book_id', 'part_of_speech'])

# Concordance (one row per occurrence)
lxx_concordance('G2316', book='Isa')

# Formatted terminal summary
print_lxx_query(strongs='G1242')   # by-book table + verb breakdown
print_lxx_query(strongs='G2316', book_group='prophets')

# Deuterocanonical books (excluded by default)
query_lxx(strongs='G4678', include_deuterocanon=True)  # Wisdom books
```

The LXX corpus completes the **OT → LXX → NT pipeline**:
- `lxx_alignment()` (MACULA Hebrew) gives word-level Hebrew→LXX alignment
- `lxx_query()` / `lxx_by_book()` give LXX morphology and distribution
- `query()` / `query_syntax()` (TAGNT / MACULA Greek) give NT usage

**Slash command:** `/lxx-query G1242` or `/lxx-query G2316 prophets`

### OT Speaker Attribution

`ot_speaker.py` identifies who speaks in the Hebrew Bible by resolving MACULA
Hebrew `subjref` links on speech-verb tokens (אָמַר, דָּבַר, קָרָא, עָנָה,
צָוָה, שָׁלַח, נָאַם) to their grammatical subjects.

```python
from bible_grammar import (speaker_verses, divine_speech_by_book, who_speaks,
                            divine_speech_verses, print_speaker_summary,
                            print_divine_speech_by_book, speaker_report,
                            GOD_OT_SPEECH)

# What does YHWH+Elohim say in Isaiah?
print_speaker_summary(['H3068', 'H0430'], books=['Isa'], label='YHWH+Elohim')

# Per-book divine speech counts with percentage of all speech in that book
print_divine_speech_by_book()
# → Lamentations 31.8% | Psalms 25.9% | Leviticus 22.0% | …

# Who speaks in Job? (character breakdown)

# → Job 47 tokens | Elihu 10 | El 7 | Satan 5 | YHWH 5 | Eliphaz 4 | …

# List all verses where YHWH speaks in Jeremiah

### Louw-Nida Domain Search

`domain_search.py` queries the Greek NT by Louw-Nida semantic domain. Each
MACULA Greek token carries a `domain` code (e.g. `033006`) and an `ln` reference
(e.g. `33.69`), covering all 93 top-level Louw-Nida domains.

```python
from bible_grammar import (query_domain, top_domain_words, domain_profile,
                            domain_role_search, domain_comparison,
                            print_domain_summary, print_domain_role,
                            DOMAIN_NAMES, THEOLOGY_DOMAINS)

# Top words in the Communication domain (33)
print_domain_summary(33, top_n=15)

# Supernatural Beings domain (12) in Revelation
print_domain_summary(12, book='Rev')

# Communication-domain verbs where God (Theos) is the subject
print_domain_role(33, ['G2316'], subject_label='Theos')
# → λέγω 33.69 (say), καλέω 33.312 (call), ἐπαγγέλλομαι 33.286 (promise) …

# Religious Activity domain (53) where Jesus acts in the Gospels
print_domain_role(53, ['G2424'], books=['Mat', 'Mrk', 'Luk', 'Jhn'])

# Semantic domain profile of a NT book
domain_profile('Rom', top_n=15)

# Compare domain profiles across books
domain_comparison(['Rom', 'Heb', 'Rev'], top_n=12)
# → Romans: Communication 11.5%, Supernatural 7.1%, Affirmation 6.4%
# → Revelation: Geographical 6.8%, Number/Quantity 6.7%, Artifacts 5.9%

# Theological domain groupings

### Cross-Testament Trajectory

`trajectory.py` stitches together the full lexical journey of a word from Hebrew OT
→ LXX Septuagint → Greek NT, assessing whether the NT adopts the LXX's vocabulary
(high continuity) or diverges to new word choices.

**Pipeline stages:**
1. OT Hebrew stats (`word_study`)
2. OT → LXX alignment (MACULA Hebrew inline Greek — word-level precision)
3. LXX corpus distribution (`lxx.parquet`)
4. NT usage (TAGNT parquet)
5. Continuity assessment: `high | medium | low | none`

```python
from bible_grammar import print_trajectory, save_trajectory_report, word_trajectory

# Terminal report: shalom OT → LXX εἰρήνη → NT
print_trajectory('H7965')

# Terminal report: ruach/spirit OT → LXX πνεῦμα → NT
print_trajectory('H7307')

# Terminal report: berith/covenant OT → LXX διαθήκη → NT
print_trajectory('H1285')

# Start from Greek side
print_trajectory('G1515')    # eirene in NT/LXX

# Full Markdown report + 3-panel chart (OT blue | LXX green | NT red)
path = save_trajectory_report('H7965')

# Full pipeline dict (all stages accessible programmatically)
t = word_trajectory('H7965')
print(t['continuity'])        # 'high'
print(t['continuity_note'])   # explanation
print(t['lxx_total'])         # tokens in LXX
print(t['nt_total'])          # tokens in NT
```

Continuity levels:
- **high** — NT uses the same Greek word as the LXX's dominant rendering (≥80% consistent)
- **medium** — same word, but LXX rendering is split (<80% consistent) or vice versa
- **low** — NT uses a different word than the LXX primary rendering
- **none** — insufficient data

### Hebrew Poetry Analysis

`poetry.py` analyzes the structure of Hebrew poetry using the cantillation accent
system embedded in the Masoretic Text. The **Etnahta** (U+0591) marks the primary
mid-verse division (end of A-colon); **Zaqef Gadol/Revia** may mark a C-colon.

**Features:**
- **Cola splitting** — every verse split into 2 or 3 cola by accent detection
- **Parallel word pairs** — content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) paired across
  A/B cola; aggregated across a whole book to reveal canonical word pairs
- **Parallelism classification** — heuristic classifier: synonymous (high
  lexical/domain overlap) · antithetic (negation in B-colon) · synthetic (default)
- **Book statistics** — type distribution and cross-book comparison

```python
from bible_grammar import print_verse_analysis, print_book_pairs, print_parallelism_stats

# Cola split + parallelism type for one verse
print_verse_analysis('Psa', 19, 2)
# → Colon A: "The heavens declare the glory of God"
# → Colon B: "and the work of his hands"
# → Colon C: "the firmament shows"
# → Parallelism: SYNTHETIC

print_verse_analysis('Pro', 10, 1)
# → Colon A: "A wise son makes a father glad"  (+ superscription)
# → Colon C: "the grief of his mother" (shared lemma: בֵּן son)

# Most frequent A/B parallel word pairs in Proverbs
print_book_pairs('Pro', top_n=20, min_count=2)
# → חׇכְמָה/דַּעַת (wisdom/knowledge) × 4
# → מֶלֶךְ/רָזַן (kings/rulers) × 3
# → פֶּה/שָׂפָה (mouth/lips) × 3

# Parallelism type breakdown
print_parallelism_stats('Pro')
```

#### Chiasm Detection

Identifies A B … B' A' mirror structure across a verse range using lemma-level
Jaccard similarity between mirrored verse pairs. Each verse's content-word lemmas
are compared against its structural mirror.

```python
from bible_grammar import print_chiasm, detect_chiasm

# Psalm 8 — framed by "how majestic is your name" (vv. 1, 9)
print_chiasm('Psa', 8, 1, 9)

# Programmatic access: get raw scores and pattern labels
result = detect_chiasm('Psa', 23, 1, 6)
print(result['pattern'])       # ['A', 'B', 'C', "C'", "B'", "A'"]
print(result['mean_score'])    # average Jaccard across mirror pairs
print(result['is_chiasm'])     # True if mean_score >= 0.10
```

**Slash command:** `/poetry chiasm <book> <ch> <vs1> <vs2>`
- `/poetry chiasm Psa 8 1 9`   — Psalm 8 frame
- `/poetry chiasm Psa 23 1 6`  — Psalm 23

#### Acrostic Detection

Checks whether successive verses begin with successive letters of the Hebrew
alphabet (א through ת = 22 letters). Supports stanza acrostics where groups of
verses share the same opening letter (e.g. Psalm 119: 8 verses per letter).

```python
from bible_grammar import print_acrostic, acrostic_known, KNOWN_ACROSTICS

# Lamentations 1 — 100% match (all 22 letters)
print_acrostic('Lam', 1, 1, 22)

# Psalm 119 — stanza acrostic: 8 verses per letter, 176 verses total
print_acrostic('Psa', 119, 1, 176, stanza_size=8)

# Check what acrostics are known for a book
print(acrostic_known('Psa'))   # [9, 10, 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, 145]
print(KNOWN_ACROSTICS)         # full registry: Psa, Pro, Lam, Nah
```

**Slash command:** `/poetry acrostic <book> <ch> <vs1> <vs2> [stanza]`

- `/poetry acrostic Psa 119 1 176 8`   — Psalm 119 (stanza=8)

#### Meter Analysis

Estimates the stress pattern per colon using content-word counting (heuristic
approximation of classical Hebrew stress-counting meter). Syllables are estimated
from vowel-point counts in the MT. The qinah (3+2) pattern characteristic of
lament poetry is flagged automatically.

```python
from bible_grammar import print_verse_meter, print_meter_stats, verse_meter

# Single verse — stress count + syllable estimate per colon
print_verse_meter('Lam', 1, 1)
# → Colon A: 3 stresses, ~10 syllables
# → Colon B: 2 stresses, ~7 syllables
# → pattern=3+2  type=qinah(3+2)

# Meter distribution across a whole book
print_meter_stats('Lam')

# Programmatic access
m = verse_meter('Psa', 23, 1)
print(m['pattern'])     # e.g. '3+3'

```

### Hebrew Verbal Syntax Analysis

`verbal_syntax.py` provides five analysis tools for studying the Hebrew verb system
at the syntactic and discourse level — designed for 2nd-year Biblical Hebrew study.

#### Verb Form Profile

Distribution of all eleven Hebrew verb conjugation types for a book or chapter.
Immediately reveals the text-type: narrative is wayyiqtol-heavy; poetry is
yiqtol/qatal-heavy; prophecy blends qatal (certainty) with yiqtol (future).

```python
from bible_grammar import print_verb_form_profile, verb_form_chart

# Genesis: 42% wayyiqtol (narrative prose)
print_verb_form_profile('Gen')

# Psalms: 31% yiqtol, 25% qatal, 6% wayyiqtol (poetry)
print_verb_form_profile('Psa')

# Chapter-level profile
print_verb_form_profile('Gen', chapter=1)

# Save a bar chart PNG
verb_form_chart('Gen', output_path='output/charts/ot/verbs/verb-forms-gen.png')
```

#### Wayyiqtol Chain Analysis

Identifies consecutive wayyiqtol sequences (the "and he did X, and he did Y"
narrative backbone) and reports what breaks each chain — whether a jussive,
qatal summary, participle, or direct speech marker.

```python
from bible_grammar import print_wayyiqtol_chains, wayyiqtol_chains

# Genesis 1: 15 chains, longest = 7 verbs; chains break on God's speech (jussive)
print_wayyiqtol_chains('Gen', 1)

# Programmatic access
chains = wayyiqtol_chains('Ruth', 1)
for c in chains:
    print(c['length'], c['break_type'])
```

#### Infinitive Usage

Analyses infinitive construct (with governing preposition) and infinitive absolute
(with paronomastic detection). Shows whether inf-construct follows לְ (purpose),
בְּ/כ (temporal), אחרי (sequence), or serves as subject/object.

```python
from bible_grammar import print_infinitive_usage

# Genesis: 66% lamed (purpose), detects Gen 2:16-17 paronomastic inf-abs
print_infinitive_usage('Gen')

# Deuteronomy: rich in inf-construct (legal instructions)
print_infinitive_usage('Deut')
```

Key findings for teaching:
- Gen 2:16 `אָכֹל תֹּאכַל` — paronomastic inf-abs ⟦you may freely eat⟧
- Gen 2:17 `מוֹת תָּמוּת` — paronomastic inf-abs ⟦you shall surely die⟧
- ~66% of all inf-construct in Genesis governed by לְ (purpose/result clauses)

#### Clause Type Profile

Counts verbal vs. nominal clauses, plus negation tokens, conditional markers
(אִם, לוּ), relative clauses (אֲשֶׁר), and interrogatives.

```python
from bible_grammar import print_clause_type_profile

# Genesis: 95% verbal clauses (prose narrative — almost always finite verb)
print_clause_type_profile('Gen')

# Proverbs: more nominal clauses (aphorisms, stative descriptions)
print_clause_type_profile('Pro')
```

#### Stem (Binyan) Distribution

Frequency of each binyan — Qal, Niphal, Piel, Pual, Hiphil, Hophal, Hithpael,
and rarer stems. Useful for asking: where does the author concentrate Hiphil
(causative) vs. Piel (intensive)?

```python
from bible_grammar import print_stem_distribution, stem_chart

# Genesis: Qal 77%, Hiphil 10%, Piel 7%
print_stem_distribution('Gen')

# Save horizontal bar chart
stem_chart('Gen')
```

#### Disjunctive Clause Analysis

A **disjunctive clause** opens with a noun, pronoun, or adjective rather than a
verb — subject-first word order that signals a departure from the main narrative
line. Discourse grammarians (Longacre, Niccacci, Waltke-O'Connor) identify these
functions: circumstantial background, contrastive, resumptive, flashback, and
summary/comment.

```python
from bible_grammar import (print_disjunctive_clauses, print_disjunctive_in_chains,
                            disjunctive_clauses, disjunctive_in_chains)

# Survey disjunctives in a chapter
print_disjunctive_clauses('Gen', 1)
# → Gen 1:1  noun/qatal  — circumstantial / background
# → Gen 1:2  noun/qatal  — circumstantial / background (וְהָאָרֶץ הָיְתָה תֹהוּ)

print_disjunctive_clauses('Gen', 37)
# → Gen 37:3  noun/qatal  — "Israel loved Joseph" (contrastive with brothers)
# → Gen 37:36 noun/qatal  — Midianites subplot (new background thread)

# Cross-reference with wayyiqtol chains to see flow interruptions
print_disjunctive_in_chains('Gen', 37)
# → Chain 14 [vv34-35] terminated by disjunctive at v36 (subplot begins)

# Whole-book survey
df = disjunctive_clauses('Gen')
print(df['discourse_function'].value_counts())
```

**Slash commands:**
- `/verbal-syntax disj <book> [ch]`      — list all disjunctive clauses
- `/verbal-syntax disjchains <book> <ch>` — chains + interruption annotations

#### Conditional Clause Analysis

Detects אִם (real conditions), לוּ (wish/irreal), and לוּלֵא (counterfactual), and
classifies each by protasis verb form:

| Type | Particle | Protasis verb | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Real — open future | אִם | yiqtol | "if you do X" (most common) |
| Real — past/present | אִם | qatal | "if you have done X" |
| Real — stative | אִם | participle | habitual/general truth |
| Irreal — wish | לוּ | yiqtol | "if only…" |
| Irreal — counterfactual | לוּ / לוּלֵא | qatal | "had it not been…" |

```python
from bible_grammar import (print_conditional_clauses, print_conditional_summary,
                            conditional_clauses, conditional_summary)

# Chapter-level: Gen 18 Abraham bargaining (4× אִם + yiqtol, 1× אִם + qatal)
print_conditional_clauses('Gen', 18)

# Whole-book summary
print_conditional_summary('Gen')
# → 45% real-future (אִם + yiqtol)

- `/verbal-syntax condsum <book>`      — summary distribution for a whole book

#### Relative Clause Analysis

Detects אֲשֶׁר, שֶׁ, and דִּי relative markers and infers the syntactic role of
the relative pronoun within its clause using a three-step heuristic:

| Inferred role | Heuristic |
|---|---|
| **subject** | No overt subject in relative clause — אֲשֶׁר fills the slot |
| **object** | Rel clause has own subject, OR resumptive pronoun (role=o) |
| **oblique** | Resumptive pronoun with role=p (prepositional) |
| **verbless** | No verb in relative clause (predicate nominal / headless) |

Also classifies antecedent by semantic category: person / place / time / thing.

```python
from bible_grammar import (print_relative_clauses, print_relative_summary,
                            relative_clauses, relative_clause_summary)

# Chapter detail
print_relative_clauses('Gen', 3)
# → 5 object relatives (qatal), 1 subject relative

# Whole-book role × verb-form breakdown
print_relative_summary('Gen')
# Gen: 62% object, 34% subject; qatal dominates (57%)

# Cross-book comparison
import pandas as pd
books = ['Gen', 'Rut', 'Psa', 'Pro']
dfs = {b: relative_clauses(b) for b in books}
pivot = pd.DataFrame(
    {b: df['inferred_role'].value_counts() for b, df in dfs.items()}
).fillna(0).astype(int)
```

**Slash commands:**
- `/verbal-syntax rel <book> [ch]`   — relative clauses with role inference
- `/verbal-syntax relsum <book>`      — role/verb-form/antecedent summary

#### Aspect Comparison Across Genres

Hebrew verb form distribution is one of the clearest markers of genre.
`aspect_comparison` builds a side-by-side percentage table; `aspect_comparison_chart`
saves a grouped bar chart PNG.

| Genre | Dominant forms | Signature |
|---|---|---|
| Narrative (Gen, Josh…) | wayyiqtol ~41% | Sequential foreground action |
| Legal (Deu, Lev) | weqatal 18% + yiqtol 28% | Future obligation sequences |
| Prophecy (Isa, Jer) | qatal + yiqtol balanced | Prophetic perfect; vision participles |
| Poetry (Psa, Pro) | yiqtol 31–36% + ptc.act 13–26% | Petition, habitual truth |

```python
from bible_grammar import (print_aspect_comparison, aspect_comparison_chart,
                            aspect_comparison, GENRE_SETS)

# Side-by-side percentage table
print_aspect_comparison(['Gen', 'Psa', 'Isa', 'Deu'])
# wayyiqtol: Gen 41.8% / Psa 5.8% / Isa 5.0% / Deu 7.3%  ← narrative marker
# yiqtol:    Gen 10.7% / Psa 30.9% / Isa 29.6% / Deu 27.6% ← poetry/law
# weqatal:   Gen  3.3% / Psa  0.8% / Isa  9.4% / Deu 18.0% ← Deu legal sequences

# Save grouped bar chart
path = aspect_comparison_chart(['Gen', 'Psa', 'Isa', 'Deu', 'Pro'])
# → output/charts/ot/verbs/aspect_comparison_Gen_Psa_Isa_Deu_Pro.png

# Raw DataFrame for custom analysis
df = aspect_comparison(['Gen', 'Psa', 'Isa', 'Deu'])
# MultiIndex columns: (book, 'count') and (book, 'pct')

# Use pre-defined genre book lists
print(GENRE_SETS['narrative'])  # ['Gen', 'Exod', 'Num', 'Josh', ...]
print(GENRE_SETS['poetry'])     # ['Psa', 'Pro', 'Job', 'Sng', 'Lam']
```

**Slash command:**
- `/verbal-syntax aspect <book1> [book2 ...]` — side-by-side comparison + saves PNG

#### Discourse Particle Tagging

Seven key Hebrew discourse particles classified by discourse function using
MACULA's English gloss annotations:

| Particle | Category | Functions |
|---|---|---|
| הִנֵּה | presentative | attention-getter ("behold/look") |
| כִּי | connective | causal · content · adversative · conditional · asseverative · temporal |
| וְ | connective | sequential · adversative · logical · emphatic · temporal |
| לָכֵן | consequence | "therefore / so" |
| עַתָּה | temporal | discourse "now" (logical pivot) |
| גַּם | additive | "also / even" |
| אַךְ | restrictive | "only / surely / but" |

```python
from bible_grammar import (print_discourse_particles, print_particle_summary,
                            discourse_particles, discourse_particle_summary)

# Chapter detail — Isaiah 40 has three הִנֵּה presentatives + כִּי clauses
print_discourse_particles('Isa', 40)

# Book summary — Genesis כִּי breakdown
print_particle_summary('Gen')
# כִּי: 55.2% causal · 28.6% content · 4.8% temporal · 4.1% adversative

# Deuteronomy: more conditional כִּי (legal "if…then" protases)
print_particle_summary('Deu')

# Cross-book כִּי comparison
from bible_grammar import discourse_particle_summary
import pandas as pd
frames = {b: discourse_particle_summary(b) for b in ['Gen', 'Deu', 'Isa', 'Psa']}
```

**Slash commands:**
- `/verbal-syntax particles <book> [ch]` — per-verse particle listing with function
- `/verbal-syntax ptclsum <book>` — summary per particle type for a whole book

### Theological Term Map

Traces key theological concepts across OT Hebrew → LXX Greek → NT Greek,
showing whether NT authors adopt LXX vocabulary or use fresh terminology.

```python
from bible_grammar import term_map, print_term_map, THEOLOGICAL_TERMS

# Built-in theological domains
print(list(THEOLOGICAL_TERMS.keys()))
# ['Covenant / Faithfulness', 'Holiness / Purity', 'Righteousness / Justice', ...]

# Full trajectory for "Covenant / Faithfulness"
print_term_map('Covenant / Faithfulness')

# Custom term set
term_map(['H7965', 'G1515'])   # שָׁלוֹם / εἰρήνη (peace)
```

---

### Synonym Comparison

Side-by-side comparison of near-synonym Hebrew or Greek roots.

```python
from bible_grammar import compare_synonyms, print_synonym_comparison

# אָהַב vs חָשַׁק (love vs desire)
print_synonym_comparison(['H157', 'H2836'])

# NT love words
print_synonym_comparison(['G26', 'G5368'])   # ἀγάπη vs φιλέω

# Uses Hebrew/Greek lemmas directly (auto-resolved to Strong's)
print_synonym_comparison(['שָׁלוֹם', 'εἰρήνη'])
```

Output includes: frequency comparison with bars, LXX translation equivalents
(shared renderings marked †), OT→LXX→NT trajectory, book distribution, and
morphological form breakdown.

---

### Phrase & Proximity Search

Search for consecutive word sequences or statistically proximate words in the
Hebrew OT, Greek NT, or LXX.

```python
from bible_grammar import phrase_search, print_phrase_results
from bible_grammar import proximity_search, print_proximity_results

# Consecutive phrase search — tokens can be Strong's numbers, lemmas, or '*' wildcard
results = phrase_search(['H3068', 'H559'], corpus='OT')   # יְהוָה + אָמַר
print_phrase_results(results)

# "word" near "spirit" within 5 words (ordered, any direction)
results = proximity_search(['H1697', 'H7307'], within=5, corpus='OT')
print_proximity_results(results)

# Cross-verse proximity is supported; distance is in word tokens
results = proximity_search(['G3056', 'G2316'], within=10, corpus='NT')
```

Token types:
- Strong's number string: `'H7307'`, `'G3056'`
- Hebrew/Greek lemma (auto-resolved): `'רוּחַ'`, `'λόγος'`
- Wildcard: `'*'` matches any word
- Constraint dict: `{'strongs': 'H7307', 'stem': 'Qal'}` for morphological filtering

### Divine Names Analysis

Tracks the major divine names and christological titles across three corpora with
frequency tables, per-section breakdowns, stacked bar charts, and heatmaps.

**OT Hebrew:** YHWH (H3068G), Elohim (H0430), Adonai (H0136), El (H0410), Yah (H3050), Shaddai (H7706)  
**LXX Greek:** Kyrios (G2962), Theos (G2316)  
**NT Greek:** Theos (G2316), Kyrios (G2962), Iesous (G2424G), Christos (G5547), Pater (G3962), Pneuma (G4151)

```python
from bible_grammar import print_divine_names, divine_name_table
from bible_grammar import divine_name_by_section, divine_names_chart, divine_names_report

# Terminal summary
print_divine_names('OT')    # YHWH 65.8% | Elohim 26.3% | Adonai 4.4% …
print_divine_names('NT')    # Theos 30.2% | Iesous 22.1% | Kyrios 16.9% …

# Distribution by canonical section
divine_name_by_section('OT')   # Torah / Historical / Wisdom / Prophets

# Charts
divine_names_chart('NT', chart_type='stacked_bar')
divine_names_chart('OT', chart_type='heatmap')

# Full Markdown report (OT + LXX + NT)
divine_names_report()
```

Notable finding: **Adonai** is overwhelmingly a prophetic title (343 of 440 OT occurrences
are in the Prophets, 222 in Ezekiel alone). **Christos** concentrates heavily in Paul
(403 of 571 NT occurrences), while **Iesous** dominates the Gospels & Acts.

---

### Genre Comparison

Compares morphological patterns across the literary genres of the OT and NT —
verb stems, conjugations, tense, voice, mood, and part-of-speech distribution.

```python
from bible_grammar import genre_compare, print_genre_compare
from bible_grammar import genre_heatmap, genre_report

# OT: verb stem distribution across Torah / Historical / Wisdom / Prophets
print_genre_compare('OT', feature='verb_stem')
print_genre_compare('OT', feature='verb_conjugation')

# NT: verb tense/mood distribution across Gospels / Pauline / General
print_genre_compare('NT', feature='verb_tense')
print_genre_compare('NT', feature='verb_mood')

# Heatmap chart
genre_heatmap('OT', feature='verb_stem',
              output_path='output/charts/both/genre/ot-genre-verb-stem.png')

# Full Markdown report (OT + NT, all features)
genre_report()
```

Key findings:
- **Consecutive Perfect (wayyiqtol)** dominates Historical prose (36% of verbs) vs. Wisdom (5%) — narrative drive vs. reflection
- **Imperfect** dominates Wisdom poetry (31%) — habitual, timeless, or ongoing action
- **Paul** has the highest Present tense ratio (55%) in the NT — characteristic of didactic/hortatory style
- **Revelation/General letters** have the highest participle density (28%)

---

### Hapax Legomena

Words occurring only once in a given corpus or book.

```python
from bible_grammar import hapax_legomena, hapax_table, hapax_summary

# All hapax in Job
hapax_legomena(book='Job')

# Summary counts per book across the OT
hapax_summary(corpus='OT')
```

---

### Parallel Passages

Compare parallel passages between books (e.g. Samuel/Kings vs Chronicles,
Synoptic parallels).

```python
from bible_grammar import parallel_passage, print_parallel

print_parallel('2Sa', 22, 'Psa', 18)   # Psalm 18 = 2 Samuel 22
print_parallel('Mat', 5, 'Luk', 6)     # Sermon on the Mount / Plain
```

---

### HTML & CSV Export

Export any analysis as a self-contained HTML report (inline CSS and embedded charts,
ready to open in a browser or share) plus companion CSV data files.

```python
from bible_grammar import (export_word_study, export_semantic_profile,
                            export_genre_compare, export_divine_names, export_all)

# Word study → HTML + CSV

export_all()
```

Output directories:
- `output/exports/html/` — standalone HTML files (gitignored, regenerated on demand)
- `output/exports/csv/`  — raw CSV files organised by analysis type (gitignored)

---

### Charts

```python
from bible_grammar import charts

# Bar chart from any DataFrame
charts.bar_chart(df, x='stem', title='Verb Stems in Isaiah',
                 output_path='output/charts/ot/verbs/isaiah_stems.png')

# Heatmap (e.g. tense × voice)
charts.heatmap(df, index='tense', columns='voice', title='Tense × Voice in John')

# Grouped bar (e.g. stems per book)
charts.grouped_bar(df, x='book_id', hue='stem', title='Stems by Book')

# LXX consistency heatmap
from bible_grammar import consistency_heatmap
consistency_heatmap(['H7307', 'H2617'], output_path='output/charts/ot/lexicon/consistency.png')
```

### Hebrew Preposition Analysis

`prepositions.py` provides frequency, collocate, and object-type analysis for
Biblical Hebrew prepositions using the MACULA OT syntax data (~64,000 prep tokens,
46 unique lemmas). Inseparable prepositions (בְּ, לְ, כְּ) are tokenized as
separate rows with clean pointed lemmas.

```python
from bible_grammar import (prep_frequency, prep_by_book, prep_distribution_table,
                            prep_collocates, prep_object_types, compare_preps,
                            MAJOR_PREPS, PREP_GLOSS, BOOK_GROUPS)

# OT-wide frequency table
prep_frequency(top_n=15)
# → לְ 31.4% · בְּ 24.7% · מִן 12.3% · עַל 9.0% · אֶל 8.9% …

# Torah subset
prep_frequency(book_group='Torah', top_n=10)

# Distribution of לְ across all OT books
prep_by_book('לְ')

# Side-by-side count of major prepositions by book group
prep_distribution_table()

# Top noun collocates of לְ (purpose / indirect object)
prep_collocates('לְ', pos='noun', top_n=20)

# Top noun collocates of בְּ in Genesis
prep_collocates('בְּ', pos='noun', top_n=15, book='Gen')

# Grammatical types of what follows מִן
prep_object_types('מִן')

# Side-by-side collocate comparison: לְ vs אֶל (both mark direction)
compare_preps('לְ', 'אֶל', pos='noun', top_n=20)
```

### Greek Preposition Analysis

`greek_prepositions.py` provides frequency, case-binding, and collocate analysis for
Greek prepositions in both the NT (MACULA Nestle1904, ~10,900 tokens) and the LXX
(CenterBLC Rahlfs 1935, ~55,000 tokens).

**Case binding** — Greek prepositions govern one or more cases depending on meaning.
Case is not stored on the preposition token; it is determined by an adjacency join
to the immediately following word (`word_num + 1`), normalized to Title case
(Accusative, Genitive, Dative).

```python
from bible_grammar import (
    greek_prep_frequency, greek_prep_by_book, greek_prep_distribution_table,
    greek_prep_cases, greek_prep_collocates, compare_greek_preps, nt_lxx_compare,
    NT_MAJOR_PREPS, LXX_MAJOR_PREPS, PREP_GLOSS,
)

# Distribution by book group
greek_prep_distribution_table(corpus='nt')   # Gospels / Acts / Pauline / …
greek_prep_distribution_table(corpus='lxx')  # Torah / Historical / Wisdom / …

# Case-binding profiles

greek_prep_cases('διά', corpus='nt')   # 57.3% Genitive (through) · 41.2% Accusative (because of)
greek_prep_cases('ἐπί', corpus='nt')   # tricase: Accusative / Genitive / Dative

# NT vs. LXX case-binding comparison

## Data Notes

- **Aramaic:** Daniel 2:4–7:28 and Ezra 4:8–6:18, 7:12–26 are tagged `language=Aramaic`.
- **Pronominal suffixes:** Hebrew pronominal suffixes are encoded as separate word tokens
  (own `word_num` row). When using proximity search, add ~30% to your mental window size
  to account for suffix tokens.
- **Untagged tokens:** Some morphology fields are blank for prefix tokens (conjunction ו,
  preposition ב, etc.) attached to a word where STEPBible encodes the prefix separately.
- **Versification:** TAHOT follows NRSV versification; some chapter/verse numbers differ
  from KJV (especially in Psalms and some prophetic books).
- **Strong's normalization:** The library normalizes Strong's numbers throughout —
  zero-padding (H530 ↔ H0530) and variant suffixes (H1697A → H1697) are handled
  transparently.
- **Word counts:** TAHOT ~284k words, TAGNT ~142k words, LXX ~480k words,
  KJV 24,570 verses, Vulgate Clementine 24,909 verses.
